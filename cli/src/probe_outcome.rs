//! Common contract for forge's typed probe outcomes.
//!
//! Sixteen sibling modules — [`crate::chart_dependencies`],
//! [`crate::cis_k8s_pass_rate`], [`crate::cosign`],
//! [`crate::deployment_manifest`], [`crate::flux_source_verification`],
//! [`crate::git_signature`], [`crate::helm_lint`],
//! [`crate::helm_provenance`], [`crate::helm_release_signature`],
//! [`crate::kensa_policy`], [`crate::network_policy_admission`],
//! [`crate::nix_reproducibility`], [`crate::oci_architecture`],
//! [`crate::pod_health`], [`crate::pod_listing`], and
//! [`crate::security_scan`] (which carries two distinct typed probe
//! outcomes, `SbomProbeOutcome` and `VulnScanProbeOutcome`) — each carry
//! a typed `*Outcome` enum with at least one variant that names the "no
//! probe ran / no evidence collected" world. The variant name is
//! `ProbeAbsent` in most modules and `Absent` in three (`SbomProbe`,
//! `VulnScanProbe`, `OciArchitecture`); the surface name varies because
//! the shape was discovered seventeen commits at a time, but the
//! load-bearing structural invariant is identical at every site:
//!
//! 1. The absent variant identifies as absent under `is_probe_absent()`.
//! 2. Every other variant identifies as not-absent.
//!
//! The bare `bool` returned by `is_probe_absent` carries the structural
//! discriminator the prior bare-literal attestation-call-site code
//! erased — every `vec![]` / `false` / `0` / `0.0` /
//! `Blake3Hash::digest(b"pending-…")` literal that the typed-primitive
//! family closed over commits b98eb5a → 5c0d121 collapsed three or four
//! operational worlds into a single surface value, where this trait now
//! lets a downstream verifier recover the kind-of-claim "did a probe run
//! at all?" from any implementor in one line of generic code.
//!
//! ## What this module does NOT do
//!
//! It does not introduce a generic `Claim` associated type or a generic
//! claim-collapse method. The seventeen probe outcomes surface
//! heterogeneous claim types — `bool` (10 of 17), `usize` (1), `f64` (1),
//! [`tameshi::Blake3Hash`](https://docs.rs/tameshi) (3, but only when the
//! `attestation` feature is on), `Vec<DependencyHash>` (1), `String` (1),
//! `(Blake3Hash, usize, usize)` (1), `Option<&str>` (1, alongside its
//! sibling `bool`) — and a single associated type would either force
//! every consumer through expensive cloning (for the `Vec` and `String`
//! cases), require a lifetime parameter (for the `Option<&str>` case),
//! or push the consumer back to a per-implementor match. The bare-bool
//! `is_probe_absent()` predicate is the largest common shape every
//! implementor admits cheaply, and is sufficient to drive the load-
//! bearing downstream consumer this trait enables — the probe-coverage
//! telemetry summary a follow-up commit will land at the
//! `compose_product_certification` call site.
//!
//! ## What this trait enables
//!
//! The first downstream consumer this trait names structurally is the
//! probe-coverage telemetry signal: given a slice of `&dyn ProbeOutcome`
//! references collected at the attestation composition site, a generic
//! helper can count `(probes_ran, probes_absent)` and emit a
//! `tracing::info!` (or a structural field on the
//! [`ProductCertification`](tameshi)) recording exactly how much of the
//! attestation pipeline produced evidence vs. how much surfaced default
//! claims. The `&dyn ProbeOutcome` object-safety requirement is the
//! reason this trait is intentionally minimal: a single `&self -> bool`
//! method admits the trait-object form without any boxing of a
//! heterogeneous `Claim` type. A future commit that lands the helper
//! will compose against this trait without needing to re-derive the
//! shape per-implementor.
//!
//! ## The macro
//!
//! Every implementor's body is identical:
//! `matches!(self, Self::<absent-variant>)`. The `impl_probe_outcome!`
//! macro factors the boilerplate so each module adds exactly one
//! invocation line:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! crate::impl_probe_outcome!(CosignVerifyOutcome, ProbeAbsent);
//! crate::impl_probe_outcome!(SbomProbeOutcome, Absent);
//! ```
//!
//! The macro takes the type and the absent variant's bare identifier;
//! both `ProbeAbsent` and `Absent` are supported by the shared pattern.
//! A future regression that swapped the match arms inside an implementor
//! is structurally foreclosed: there is one match expression in the
//! macro body, and the absent variant name is the only piece supplied
//! by the caller.
